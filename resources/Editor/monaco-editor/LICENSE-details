This is a minimal redistribution of the monaco-editor-samples.
Applied licenses are shipped within the original folders.
Main changes from the original distribution are:
- Some folders have been deleted in order to keep a small size.
- The file ./browser-script-editor/index.html has been modified in order to customize behaviour when embedded in browser.
