Build
---------------
A script should be provided in order to automate the building of Python, but until it is done i'll detail all the steps here:

• launch cmd.exe
• cd %YOUR_INSTALL_PATH/Bolt/extlibs/cpython/PCBuild/
• execute "build.bat -h" from command line
• check the description for build options.
• Run the following four commands:
	build.bat -V -r -e -v -k -c Release -p x64 		-t Rebuild
	build.bat -V -r -e -v -k -c Debug 	-p x64 		-t Rebuild
	build.bat -V -r -e -v -k -c Release -p Win32 	-t Rebuild
	build.bat -V -r -e -v -k -c Debug	-p Win32 	-t Rebuild
	
	this builds Python for all configurations on windows using the latest provided VC++ compiler. Python will be built as a dynamic library, also generating python.exe and associated executables that you can try to execute from command line too in order to check if everything is okay.
• Provided you are on a 64Bit OS, try the following commands and check if everything runs ok:
	• amd64/python.exe
	* Python should start in cmd *
	• import mslib
	• mslib.gen_uuid()
	* Python should print some id *
	• exit()

• Great, you built python, you are happy !
